# Marketing-Agency

This project was created to teach the developer how to use semantic HTML elements, logically structure code, and to incorporate text where text is needed.
The URL will open up a webpage to a marketing agency that the developer has helped to structure. All the visuals were provided; however, the source code
needed to be corrected.
